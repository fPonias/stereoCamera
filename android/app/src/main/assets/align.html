<div class="title">Alignment</div>
<div class="description">
    Proper alignment is the hardest part of creating great 3d photos with this app.
    Several tools have been included to make proper alignment as painless as possible.  Some differences
    can ruin the 3d effect entirely such as differences in device alignment and zoom.  Other differences
    such as focus, color, exposure, and even time don't adversely effect the final image.
</div>
<div class="title">Zoom</div>
<div class="description">
    Unless you're shooting on identical devices, the cameras are likely to be different.  Typically,
    you have to adjust the digital zoom on one or the other devices to account for differing lens focal
    lengths.  The zoom slider on each device can be used to fine-tune their respective digital zoom settings.
</div>
<div class="image"><img src="align/01.jpg" /></div>
<div class="description">Incorrect zoom.  The device on the right is zoomed out further than the left one.</div>
<div class="image"><img src="align/02.jpg" /></div>
<div class="description">Correct zoom.  Both images are framed by the roof on top and slide on the bottom.
    Matching the framing one axis will also match it on the other.  Swapping the camera from front to
    back will use different zoom settings.</div>

<div class="title">Camera relation</div>
<div class="description">
    The cameras have to be held in a such a way to simulate human vision.  The cameras have to be vertically
    aligned with each other and have to be pointing in mostly the same direction.  You brain usually can
    account for subtle differences but the images will split if they're too different.
</div>

<div class="image"><img src="align/06.jpg" /></div>
<div class="description">
    The cameras need the same vertical alignment.  These two are at least a centimeter apart.
</div>

<div class="description">
    Make sure the devices have the same front-back tilt.  The arrows on the tilt meter should match.
</div>

<div class="description">
    Make sure devices are aligned to the same horizon.  The arrows on the level meter should match.

<div class="title">Subject distance</div>
<div class="description">
    If your subject is too close, your images aren't going to line up.  Typically it will be cropped
    on one side and the 3d will be lost.  Attempts to turn the cameras inward to fix cropping will cause
    a mismatched background and eyestrain.  There are two ways to fix this that I know of:  back off
    (obviously) or get the cameras closer together.<br/>
    <br/>
    Backing off usually results in fine 3d.  You don't need to be close to your subject to get an
    immersive 3d image.  Moving the cameras closer together can also work.  Turning the devices on their
    side or overlapping the devices can serve to move the cameras closer together.  Just remember to realign
    them.
</div>

<div class="image"><img src="align/08.jpg" /></div>
<div class="description">
    Getting too close to your subject results in cropping and mis-aligned 3d.  Field tests have shown
    that a safe minimum distance to a subject such as this BBQ is about 4 feet.
</div>

<div class="image"><img src="align/09.jpg" /></div>
<div class="description">
    Another tempting correction is to point the cameras inward.  While this does get proper 3d on the
    subject image, the background is rarely aligned.  This results in your viewers going cross-eyed
    when they switch focus from the fore to background.
</div>

<div class="description">
There are 3 solutions to the close up problem.  (1) Back off to a minimum distance of 4 feet.  Though the
subject doesn't take up the entire image, the 3d effect usually makes up for it.  (2) overlap your
devices to get the cameras closer together. (3) turn the devices sideways to also get the cameras closer
together.
</div>

<div class="image"><img src="align/10.jpg"/></div>
<div class="description">
    overlapping your cameras can reduce the effective minimum range to about 2 feet.  The problem,
    obviously, is you can't see the screen on your secondary device so proper alignment is much more difficult
    to obtain.
</div>

<div class="image"><img src="align/11.jpg" /></div>
<div class="description">
    turning your cameras sideways can also get your cameras closer together.  The drawback here is
    the cameras are harder to hold and you're more likely to drop one of them and may have difficulty
    pressing the shutter buttons.
</div>

<div class="description">
    A properly aligned subject.  The subject is in full view in both frames, the cameras are not pointed
    in, the background is aligned.  I'm standing around 4 feet from the subject.
