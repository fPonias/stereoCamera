    This privacy notice applies solely to information collected by this app. It will notify you of the following:
<br/><br/>
    <ul>
        <li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the app, how it is used and with whom it may be shared.</li>

<div class="description">
    McMunger Stereo Camera accesses image data from the device's built-in camera and audio data from the
    built-in microphone.  Images are saved locally to the two devices used to take the image.
    The app itself will not distribute any images unless explicitly initiated by the user.
    Audio data is used for synching images and is never saved.  No personally identifiable information is collected with this app,
    with the exception of the user taking a picture of themselves ("selfie").

    If you point this camera at a friend or yourself, you can reasonably assume that it will produce
    an image in the likeness of the person you pointed it at. We are not responsible for bad pictures.
    The user can delete any image captures they don't like.<br/>
