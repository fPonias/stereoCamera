    In short:  don't shoot moving targets.  They won't sync unless you're very lucky.

    Two factors contribute to this unreliability:
    Bluetooth networking and the cameras being controlled by separate computers.  The software firing
    the shutter has been observed to take anywhere from 10 - 800 ms to fire, while the signal to fire
    secondary shutter can take anywhere from 1 - 50 ms to reach the other device.  The delay is not
    consistent and makes syncing impossible with the current solutions.<br/>
    <br/>
    An experimental solution has been included in the current app that tries to guess how much longer
    the secondary camera is going to take to fire the shutter, and delays the primary shutter by that guess.
    This solution only sort-of works.  So no complaining if you're taking pics of kids that won't sit still
    for half a second.  If you want to activate this go to the preferences from the main shutter view
    and select the "Shutter Sync" checkbox.  The next time the main shutter view shows up it will fire
    the primary and secondary shutters 10 times in rapid succession.
