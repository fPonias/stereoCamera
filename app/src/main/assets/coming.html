    This project has been the work of a solo developer.  I add features in when I have the time or inclination.
    Note that I will probably stop development once I get a stable working version on the platform I use:
    android.  Features for the future:

    <ul>
        <li>iOS version - if I want to get this app out to the lucrative teenage girl market I NEED an iOS version.
            most of the processing code is in C++ already so that hard part is already done!</li>
        <li>Anaglyph images - images viewable with green-magenta glasses or red-cyan glasses.  Most of the code is done
            but it needs the ability to work with non-square images.</li>
        <li>better sync - the current sync code sucks.  I wrote most of the code for an audio sync but it needs some tweaking.</li>
        <li>image sharing - to text messaging, instagram maybe</li>
        <li>in-app image editing -  adjust alignment and minor post-production actions like exposure, contrast, color tweaking.</li>
        <li>video - This presents a whole host of syncing and video processing issues.  Maybe ffmpeg can be used.</li>
        <li>centralized web site to share cool pictures with everyone else.  Pipe-dream</li>
    </ul>
