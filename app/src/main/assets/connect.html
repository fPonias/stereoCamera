    StereoCamera uses Bluetooth to connect the two devices.  One must be specified as a primary and the
    other as a secondary.  The primary does the bulk of the work so it's best to
    desigate the better device as a primary.  To start, accept any permissions notifications that are
    prompted.

    When prompted with the new connection buttons choose "Connect to new primary" on your secondary device.
    You'll be prompted to enable Bluetooth discovery so tap yes.

    A list of possible Bluetooth connections should show up.  The name of your new secondary might
    not show up for a few seconds.
    Tap the secondary name.
